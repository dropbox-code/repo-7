## Coverage

⚠️ To compare coverage against previous code, it is required that the code is checked out with `fetch-depth: 0`:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0
```

> During the action, coverage will be calculated, and lcov.info will be saved in temporary directory `.coverage`. Please refrain from using a top level directory with this path, as this could cause issues.
