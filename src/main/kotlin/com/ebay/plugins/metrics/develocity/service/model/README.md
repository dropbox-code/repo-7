# Develocity OpenAPI Models

This module contains the OpenAPI model types for interacting with the Develocity service.
These models are generated from the OpenAPI specification and should not be modified.

See the project's [README](../../../../../../../../../../README.md) for more information
on how to (re)generate these models.
